	PresetName = Laak Jetpack
	Description = This device is actually a "living" (like a plant), biomechanical being that constantly produces a green blood-like substance, which, when superheated, turns into plasma for thrust or projectiles. It is biologically immortal, and can survive aeons on trace amounts of sulfur and ammonia.
